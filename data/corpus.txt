Neo dlr is an open-source runtime that only runs models compiled by the SageMaker Neo service. Compared to the open source dlr, the SageMaker Edge Manager SDK includes an enterprise grade on-device agent with additional security, model management, and model serving features. The SageMaker Edge Manager SDK is suitable for production deployment at scale.
SageMaker Edge Manager and AWS IoT Greengrass can work together in your IoT solution. Once your ML model is packaged with SageMaker Edge Manager, you can use the AWS IoT Greengrass OTA update feature to deploy the model package to your device. AWS IoT Greengrass allows you to monitor your IoT devices remotely, while SageMaker Edge Manager helps you monitor and maintain the ML models on the devices.
AWS offers the most breadth and depth of capabilities for running models on edge devices. We have services to support a wide range of use cases, including computer vision, voice recognition, and predictive maintenance.\n\nFor companies looking to run computer vision on edge devices such as cameras and appliances, you can use AWS Panorama. AWS Panorama offers ready-to-deploy computer vision applications for edge devices. It’s easy to get started with AWS Panorama by logging into the cloud console, specifying the model you would like to use in Amazon S3 or in SageMaker, and then writing business logic as a Python script. AWS Panorama compiles the model for the target device and creates an application package so it can be deployed to your devices with just a few clicks. In addition, independent software vendors who want to build their own custom applications can use the AWS Panorama SDK, and device manufacturers can use the Device SDK to certify their devices for AWS Panorama.\n\nCustomers who want to build their own models and have more granular control over model features can use SageMaker Edge Manager. SageMaker Edge Manager is a managed service to prepare, run, monitor, and update ML models across fleets of edge devices such as smart cameras, smart speakers, and robots for any use case such as natural langue processing, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance. SageMaker Edge Manager is for ML edge developers who want control over their model, including engineering different model features and monitoring models for drift. Any ML edge developer can use SageMaker Edge Manager through the SageMaker console and the SageMaker APIs. SageMaker Edge Manager brings the capabilities of SageMaker to build, train, and deploy models in the cloud to edge devices.
SageMaker Edge Manager is available in six Regions: US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), EU (Ireland), EU (Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo). For details, see the AWS Regional Services list.
SageMaker Neo enables ML models to train once and run anywhere in the cloud and at the edge. SageMaker Neo automatically optimizes models built with popular DL frameworks that can be used to deploy on multiple hardware platforms. Optimized models run up to 25 times faster and consume less than a tenth of the resources of typical ML models.
To get started with SageMaker Neo, sign in to the SageMaker console, choose a trained model, follow the example to compile models, and deploy the resulting model onto your target hardware platform.
SageMaker Neo contains two major components: a compiler and a runtime. First, the SageMaker Neo compiler reads models exported by different frameworks. It then converts the framework-specific functions and operations into a framework-agnostic intermediate representation. Next, it performs a series of optimizations. Then, the compiler generates binary code for the optimized operations and writes them to a shared object library. The compiler also saves the model definition and parameters into separate files. During execution, the SageMaker Neo runtime loads the artifacts generated by the compiler—model definition, parameters, and the shared object library to run the model.
No. You can train models elsewhere and use SageMaker Neo to optimize them for SageMaker ML instances or AWS IoT Greengrass supported devices.
Currently, SageMaker Neo supports the most popular DL models that power computer vision applications and the most popular decision tree models used in SageMaker today. SageMaker Neo optimizes the performance of AlexNet, ResNet, VGG, Inception, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet models trained in MXNet and TensorFlow, and classification and random cut forest models trained in XGBoost.
You can find the lists of supported cloud instances, edge devices, and framework versions in the SageMaker Neo documentation.
